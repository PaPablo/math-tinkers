# Tinkers

Little math experiments regarding interesting properties of numbers,
visualizations, brute force tests, and who knows what else.

This is inspired by the awesome YouTube channel
[Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A), and awesome
mathematicians such as
[Zvezdelina Entcheva Stankova](https://math.berkeley.edu/~stankova/),
[Hannah Fry](http://www.hannahfry.co.uk/),
[Ron Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Graham), 
[Matt Parker](http://standupmaths.com/),
[James Grimes](https://www.singingbanana.com/), and many more...

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format was chosen because of its 
simplicity, the posibility of playing around and trying new things. And also
for its posibility of [running different languages through
kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).

Feel free to clone or fork this project and contribute with new experiments.

**Note for contributors:** Please contain a subject or experiment to a single
notebook. If you need more files, please create a folder for them.
